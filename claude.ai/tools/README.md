# Tools available on `claude.ai`

**Claude's system prompt doesn't inform it about any tools that aren't currently
enabled**.  [As noted elsewhere](../retroactive-changes.md), changing tool
settings during a conversation will cause retroactive alterations to Claude's
system prompt.

(**to do:** include brief descriptions for all the tools; maybe the input
schemas, too.)

(**to do:** describe the remarkably kludgy implementation of the `artifacts` tool)
