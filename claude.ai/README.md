# The `claude.ai` user interface

In general, Claude is given *very little* information by Anthropic about the
interface via which it is communicating with the user.  The `claude.ai` UI has a
tendency to present the results of separate process to the user as though though
“Claude did it”, when in reality there's a whole lot of work going on behind the
scenes to which neither Claude nor the user are privy.  This is an unfortunate
state of affairs which this work is intended to rectify.
