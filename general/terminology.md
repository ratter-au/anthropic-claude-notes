# Terminology

Some of the confusion in discussing ‘Claude’ (and other commercial AI
assistants) comes from the polysemanticity of the name itself.  ‘Claude’ can
refer to an AI assistant character, a particular *instantiation* of that
character, a series of large language models, the infrastructure supporting and
interfacing with those models, *and* a collection of services offered by
Anthropic.  This document aims to provide a precise vocabulary for
distinguishing these referents.
