# `ratter-au/anthropic-claude-notes`

This repository contains my notes on
[Anthropic's AI chatbot Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/),
including [`claude.ai`](https://claude.ai/) and the
[Anthropic API](https://console.anthropic.com/).

**This is a work perpetually in progress.** Information given here may not be
correct, even at the time of writing.  It is almost certainly *never* complete,
given how frequently Anthropic updates their products.  This is simply a
collection of facts I've been able to gather, together with some educated
conjecture.
